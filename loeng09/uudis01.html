    <p class="paragrahv">HÀ NỘI — A South Korean tourist suffered minor injuries after he was struck by a train on Hà Nội’s ‘train street’ on Sunday.<br>
        The man reportedly ignored the sirens and barriers as the train was passing on the section running through Trần Phú - Lý Nam Đế streets in Điện Biên Ward, Ba Đình District.<br>
        He suffered very minor injuries and left the area before receiving medical treatment. After the accident, the train was brought to a halt causing traffic congestion.<br>
        Police from Ba Đình and Hoàn Kiếm districts were called to the site to collect information and find the identity of this tourist.<br>
        The authorities warned local people and tourists not to gather in crowds on the ‘train street’ to ensure the safety of themselves and the community.<br>
        Last week Hoàn Kiếm District People's Committee ordered the closure of coffee shops along the railway line and is withdrawing the shops’ business licences over safety concerns due to the large number of tourists, including many from overseas, crowding the sites to take photos of the trains running close to the houses on either side of the rail track. — VNS<br>
